# Density Based Smart Traffic Control System Using Canny Edge Detection

## üìå Project Overview

This project presents a **smart traffic control system** that adjusts green light duration based on real-time traffic congestion, detected through image processing using the **Canny Edge Detection Algorithm**.

The system captures road images, processes them to identify white pixels (typically representing vehicles or lane lines), and dynamically allocates green signal time based on the detected traffic density.

## üí° Features

- GUI built using **Tkinter**
- Image preprocessing using **Canny Edge Detection**
- White pixel count to estimate traffic density
- Dynamic green signal time allocation based on pixel ratio
- Reference image comparison for accurate traffic estimation

## üñºÔ∏è System Workflow

1. **Upload** a traffic image.
2. **Apply** the Canny Edge Detection algorithm.
3. **Count** white pixels (vehicle presence).
4. **Compare** with a reference image.
5. **Allocate** green light signal time based on the congestion level.

## üß™ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **OpenCV**
- **Tkinter**
- **Matplotlib**
- **NumPy**
- **Scipy**
- **Skimage**

## üö¶ Green Signal Allocation Logic

Based on the percentage of white pixels in the test image compared to the reference image:

| Traffic Level     | White Pixel % | Signal Time |
|-------------------|---------------|-------------|
| Very High         | ‚â• 90%         | 60 seconds  |
| High              | 85% ‚Äì 89%     | 50 seconds  |
| Moderate          | 75% ‚Äì 84%     | 40 seconds  |
| Low               | 50% ‚Äì 74%     | 30 seconds  |
| Very Low          | < 50%         | 20 seconds  |
